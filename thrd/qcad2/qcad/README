1 What is QCad?

This is QCad version 2.x. QCad is a simple 2D CAD program which runs
under Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, FreeBSD and several Unix systems.



2 License

- The QCad Community Edition for Linux, Unix systems and Mac OS X is 
  released as source code under the GPL 
  (see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt).
- QCad Professional, the QCad Professional sources and all QCad versions 
  for Windows are proprietary software.



3 Installation


3.1 Installation of Binaries

3.1.1 Linux / Mac OS X

Download the tar.gz file to any directory you prefer (e.g. /opt) and 
extract it:

tar xfvz qcad-2.0.0.0-1-demo.linux.x86.tar.gz

After extracting the tar.gz archive, there's no need to explicitly 
install QCad. 
If you have extracted the file in /opt, you should now have a directory 
called:

/opt/qcad-2.0.0.0-1-demo.linux.x86

You can run QCad by typing:

cd /opt/qcad-2.0.0.0-1-demo.linux.x86
./qcad

All files needed by QCad can reside in its own installation 
directory (recommended).

To un-install QCad, simply remove the directory where you've 
extracted it:

rm -r /opt/qcad-2.0.0.0-1-demo.linux.x86

Additionally there might be some thumbnail images and configuration 
files in your home directory:

/home/user/.qcad/
/home/user/.config/RibbonSoft/
or (OS X):
/Users/user/.qcad/
/Users/user/.config/RibbonSoft/


3.2 Installation from Sources (Professional Edition)

Please note that the source distributions of QCad are intended for
developers and people who want to run QCad on a platform for which no
binaries are available. 

3.2.1 Requirements

You need to have the following tools and libraries installed in order
to compile QCad from sources:

- Qt 4.1.1
  - qmake (part of the Qt package)
  - uic (part of the Qt package)
  - rcc (part of the Qt package)
- QSA 1.2.1 (only if you want to build scripting support)
- make
- gcc 3.x

3.2.2 Preparation

Set QTDIR to the directory where you have installed Qt. 
e.g.:
  $ export QTDIR=/opt/qt

Make sure that qmake, uic, rcc can be found in your path:
  $ qmake -v
  QMake version: 2.00a
  Using Qt version 4.1.1 in /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.1.1/lib

If that is not the case, please add the Qt binary path to your PATH
environment variable:
  export PATH=$PATH:$QTDIR/bin

3.2.3 Compilation

Change to the 'scripts' directory of your source code package:
  $ cd scripts

Run the compilation script. 

To compile QCad with scripting support, run:
  $ sh ./build_qcad.sh prof scripting

To compile QCad without scripting support, run:
  $ sh ./build_qcad.sh prof


3.3 Installation from Sources (Community Edition)

Please note that the source distributions of QCad are intended for
developers and people who want to run QCad on a platform for which no
binaries are available. 
If you are not in these two groups of people, please consider downloading 
a binary instead. Please understand that RibbonSoft cannot offer support 
for compiling and running the QCad Community Edition.

3.3.1 Requirements

You need to have the following tools and libraries installed in order
to compile QCad from sources:

- Qt 3.3 or later (Note that Qt 4 is not supported!)
  - qmake (part of the Qt package)
  - uic (part of the Qt package)
- make
- gcc 3.x

3.3.2 Preparation

Set QTDIR to the directory where you have installed Qt. 
e.g.:
  export QTDIR=/opt/qt

Set QMAKESPEC to the spec that is most suitable for your platform.
e.g.:
  export QMAKESPEC=$QTDIR/mkspecs/linux-g++

Make sure that qmake and uic can be found in your path:
  qmake -v
  Qmake version: 1.04a (Qt 3.3)

If that is not the case, please add the Qt binary path to your PATH
environment variable:
  export PATH=$PATH:$QTDIR/bin

3.3.3 Compilation

Change to the 'scripts' directory of your source code package:
  cd scripts

Run the compilation script:
  sh ./build_qcad.sh

The QCad binary itself is stored here:
  Linux/Unix: ./qcad/qcad
  Mac OS X:   ./qcad/QCad.app/Contents/MacOS/QCad



Happy hacking!
