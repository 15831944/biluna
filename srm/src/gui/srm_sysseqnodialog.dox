\section sec_srm_sysseqnodialog System Sequence Number Dialog

This dialog is used to edit the system sequence numbers. The system sequence
number contain the values of the last used sequence number.

Maintenance to these numbers can be necessary when for example a new document
was made and this document is deleted. In that case the last sequence
number used will still show the new (but deleted) number
and all subsequent new documents will have the wrong (one up)
sequence number.

Another examle is that you want the sequence numbering to start at different
number than default is used in the SRM perspective. You set here the required
number to start with the correct sequence number.

From the menu select <i>SRM &gt; Maintenance &gt; System Sequence Numbers</i>
and the below dialog will be shown:

A system type number can be searched at the top of the dialog
or a filter can be set for the system type number

The following fields can be edited:
\li seqnumbername - the system will set default names (these
can be edited for convenience)
\li sequencenumber - last used sequence number for the related field

Double click a sequencenumber or press F2 to edit the selected sequence number.

The Help button opens this help page, the OK button confirms the changes
and the Cancel button cancels the changes.
