Software License Agreement - Biluna Software

Red-Bag B.V., The Netherlands

hereinafter to be referred to as Licensor.

USE OF PRODUCT. 
"Software" means the executable code form of Licensor's software products delivered to Licensee and the documentation related thereto. "Product" means the Software, hardware (locks) and accompanying Documentation. “Licensee” means the Licensor’s opposite party, acting in the course of a business or in the course of a profession.
1.1. Evaluation Use. The terms of this Section 1.1 are applicable to Licensee if Licensee has registered as an evaluation customer. Subject to the terms herein, Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, nontransferable and temporary license to use the evaluation version of the Product solely for evaluation purposes only and productive use is expressly prohibited. The license begins upon installation or downloading and ends thirty (30) days thereafter (the "Evaluation Period'), unless agreed otherwise. When the license expires, Licensee must stop using the Product. Licensee acknowledges that the Product may be installed and used on a single CPU and only by one user at a time and that the Product may contain disabling devices that disable the Product after the expiration of the Evaluation Period. 
1.2. Production Use. The terms of this Section 1.2 are applicable to Licensee if Licensee has registered as a production use customer. Subject to the terms of the Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive and nontransferable license to use the Product for Licensee's internal business purposes for the number of CPUs, servers, sessions and/or users as specified on the order for the Product. Licensee may make one copy of the Product for back-up purposes (provided that all copyright notices and other proprietary notices included in the Product are reproduced). If Licensee would like to increase the number of CPUs, servers, sessions and/or users, Licensee must purchase additional licenses from Licensor. 
1.3. Restrictions on Use. The license granted by Licensor to Licensee to use the Product (whether for evaluation or production use) is subject to the following restrictions: (a) Licensee shall use the Product only in its original form, and shall not modify, reverse compile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or translate the Product, nor shall Licensee create any derivative works or otherwise use the Product except as specifically permitted in this Agreement and except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law; (b) Except as permitted herein, Licensee shall not rent, lease, sublicense, allow access to, or transfer the Product to any other party, by operation of law or otherwise; and (c) Licensee shall not alter, remove or cover trademark, copyright or other proprietary notices in or on the Product. 
1.4. Proprietary Rights. The Product is copyrighted material under the laws of The Netherlands and international treaty provisions. Notwithstanding the copyright, the Product contains trade secrets and confidential information of Licensor. 
1.5. Protection of Product. Licensee acknowledges that Licensor represents that the Product and all copies of it, regardless of the form or media in which the original or copies may exist, are the sole and exclusive property of Licensor. Licensee further acknowledges that Licensor represents that the Product, including the source and object codes, logic and structure, constitute valuable trade secrets of Licensor. Licensee further acknowledges that Licensor is engaged in activities which involve, and continue to involve, the use of skilled experts and the expenditure of substantial amounts of time and money. Except as expressly permitted herein, Licensee agrees to hold in confidence and not to directly or indirectly use, copy, reveal, report, publish, disclose, transfer or otherwise make available any part of the Product or trade secrets of Licensor to any third party on any basis, or utilize any of the trade secrets for any purpose not explicitly authorized by Licensor at any time whatsoever. Licensee agrees to secure and protect the Product consistent with the maintenance of Licensor's rights in the Product, as set forth herein. Licensee further acknowledges that disclosure of the trade secrets, including the Product, contrary to the terms set forth herein, would cause substantial loss of competitive advantage and other serious injury to Licensor. By accepting this License, Licensee does not become the owner of the Product; Licensor retains all right, title and interest in and to the Product. Because of the unique nature of the trade secrets, Licensee understands and agrees that Licensor will suffer irreparable harm in the event that Licensee fails to comply with any of its obligations hereunder and that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate Licensor for such breach. Accordingly, Licensee agrees that Licensor will, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce the terms of this Section. 
1.6. Export Compliance. Licensee may not download or otherwise export or re-export the Product or any underlying information or technology except in full compliance with all Dutch, EC and other applicable laws and regulations. In particular, but without limitation, none of the Product or underlying information or technology may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national resident of) countries on the list of EC- or US Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders. By licensing the Product, Licensee is agreeing to the foregoing and Licensee is representing and warranting that Licensee is not located in, under control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list. Licensee unconditionally accepts full responsibility for compliance with requirements. 
2. LICENSE FEES. 
2.1. Payment and Taxes. In consideration of the license granted pursuant to Section 1.2 and in consideration of maintenance and support provided to Licensee, Licensee agrees to pay Licensor the total non-refundable and non-cancelable license fee and applicable maintenance fee within thirty (30) days of date of Licensor's invoice. Licensee will pay all sales, use, VAT and other applicable taxes. Licensor may assess interest charges of one percent (1%) per month for late payments. 
2.2. Foreign Taxes. If Licensee installs, downloads and/or uses the Product outside The Netherlands, Licensee agrees that the amounts to be remitted to Licensor are to be the actual amounts due without withholding taxes or other assessments by authorities anywhere in the foreign location, which withholding taxes or assessments Licensee agrees to pay. Upon request by Licensor, Licensee will promptly furnish Licensor with certificates evidencing payment of such amounts. 
3. SUPPORT. 
3.1. Support Services for Evaluation Use. Licensor will provide installation support for the Product to Licensee. Support will be provided from The Netherlands between 9:00 a.m. 5:00 p.m. local time. 
3.2. Support Services for Production Use. For production use licenses, Licensee must purchase annual maintenance and support services ("Maintenance") from Licensor in order to continue to use the Software and to receive the Maintenance. Maintenance must be purchased on an annual basis beginning on the date one year after the Software is licensed continuing for a one year term unless Licensee notifies Licensor in writing of its intent not to renew Maintenance at least 90 days prior to the end of the then current term. Maintenance generally means that Licensor will provide: (i) maintenance updates and upgrades ("Maintenance Releases") if, as and when Licensor makes any such Maintenance Releases generally available to its customers and (ii) helpdesk assistance with respect to the Product, including (a) clarification of functions and features; (b) clarification of documentation; (c) guidance in the operation of the Product; and (d) Product error analysis. Licensor will use reasonable efforts to provide error corrections or work-arounds for the most severe errors as soon as possible and based upon Licensor's classification of the severity of the error. Maintenance will be provided only with respect to versions of the Product that, in accordance with Licensor policy, are then being supported by Licensor. Licensee agrees to provide Licensor with reasonable access to Licensee's personnel and equipment, if necessary, during normal business hours in order to provide Maintenance. Licensee agrees to document and promptly report all errors or malfunctions of the Product to Licensor. Licensee agrees to pay Maintenance fees when due, and if Licensee does not do so within thirty (30) days after any such amount becomes due, Licensor may suspend performance of its Maintenance obligations and may terminate this Agreement (including the right to continue to use the Software) upon notice to Licensee. 
4. TERM AND TERMINATION. 
This Agreement takes effect upon Licensee's acceptance of this Agreement and will remain in force until terminated in accordance with this Agreement. Licensee may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Licensor; provided that Licensee shall not be entitled to a refund of any portion of the license or Maintenance fees upon any such termination. Licensor may, by written notice to Licensee, terminate this Agreement immediately if any of the following events occur: (a) Licensee's breach of Section 1; (b) Licensee's material breach of any other provision of this Agreement that remains uncured within thirty (30) days after Licensor's written notice to Licensee thereof (including Licensee's failure to pay license fees or maintenance fees when due), or (c) Licensee declares bankruptcy or make an assignment to or for the benefit of creditors. Upon termination for any reason, Licensee shall immediately discontinue use of and return all complete or partial copies of the Product, in whatever form or media, and shall delete the Product from its computer libraries. Sections 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 2, 5.3 and 6 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

Licensor makes no warranty that the operation of the product will be error free or without interruption. 
6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. In no event shall licensor be liable for any loss of or damage to revenues, profits or goodwill or other direct, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind, resulting from its performance or failure to perform pursuant to the terms of this agreement, or resulting from the furnishing, performance, or use or loss of any the product or other materials delivered to licensee hereunder, including without limitation any interruption of business, whether resulting from breach of contract or breach of warranty or otherwise, even if licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum aggregate amount of money damages for which Licensor may be liable to Licensee under this Agreement, resulting from any cause whatsoever, is limited to the license fees received by Licensor for the affected Product for the twelve month period preceding the occurrence of such liability.

It is expressly understood and agreed that each and every provision of this agreement which provides for a limitation of liability or limited warranty is intended by the parties to be severable and independent of any other provision and to be enforced as such. 
7.3. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the Product and supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or verbal, between the parties.

7.6. Exclusions.
