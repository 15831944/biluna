biluna
==========

<p>Biluna is a Qt application framework. It started with the idea to make an Eclipse like (Java) framework. The framework allows the developer to start with a ready to use desktop application. The additional functionality is added by using plugins.</p>
<p>The basic framework provides a MDI (multiple document interface) window work area with docking windows at the different sides of the working area. More information is on the Qt website.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>The Biluna software is work in progress and will have limitations, bugs and plain errors. However it is used already in production environments but should still be thorougly tested before used for any purpose.</p>
<p>The framework also provides some basics:</p> 
<ul>
<li>file save function such as html, txt and xml</li>
<li>print, to printer and to pdf</li>
<li>database storage, MSAccess (limited), SQLite and MySQL</li>
<li>simple rich text viewer/editor</li>
<li>plain text editor</li>
<li>html viewer/editor</li>
<li>webbrowser</li>
</ul>
<p>The framework has some tools:</p> 
<ul>
<li>calendar</li>
<li>calculator</li>
<li>simple database report generator</li>
<li>dark style for desktop</li>
<li>create text from selected file names list</li>
<li>regular expression tester</li>
<li>simple chart type that can be used in reports</li>
</ul>
<p>The framework has some database view and editing facilities:</p> 
<ul>
<li>view and edit database tables</li>
<li>export database to other database or XML or CSV</li>
<li>limited import of XML or CSV</li>
</ul>
<p>Current available plugins include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACC - accounting</li>
<li>CRM - customer relation management</li>
<li>SRM - supplier relation management</li>
</ul>
<p>The vision for the future is to have a set of building block (framework) which will be usefull for the creation of desktop-, mobile- (Apps) and web (SAAS) applications. The last two have not been investigated yet but the intention is to use QML for the mobile apps and QtWebApps for the SAAS applications.</p>
